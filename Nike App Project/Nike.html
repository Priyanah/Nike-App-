        <!-- <div class="Nike4"></div> -->

Familiar but always fresh, the iconic Air Jordan 1 is remastered for today's sneakerhead culture. This Retro High OG version goes all in with premium leather, comfortable cushioning and classic design details.


Air Inside

The Air-Sole unit in the heel provides the same lightweight cushioning that MJ enjoyed back in his playing days.


Luxe Leather

Genuine leather in the upper provides durability and structure with a luxe touch. A textile tongue feels soft and comfortable over the top of your foot.

<p><b>Jordan .5 'Why Not?'</b>


WHY NOT?


Russell Westbrook is fast. These shoes match his quickness with updated cushioning, data-informed traction and a full-foot fit system to keep him in control. With a rugged utility look combined with a purposeful clash of colours and materials, this model speaks to the core of Russel's "Why Not?" mantra.


Energy In the Forefoot

A large-volume Zoom Air unit in the forefoot helps maximise energy return for your explosive bursts of speed.


Webbing Fit System

Floating midfoot bands, an external heel counter, webbing and laces work together to fully secure your foot.


Rugged, Multi-directional Traction

The durable rubber outsole has a rugged, data-informed traction pattern inspired by trail running shoes.
